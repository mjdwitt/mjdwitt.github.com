		<p>After a mostly uneventful summer, I’m finally back in Bloomington for the new semester! Truthfully, I moved in nearly a month ago but these first few weeks have been crazy hectic as I began not only three new CS classes, but also two awesome new jobs. Despite the summer’s general banality, however, a couple things worth noting did take place: a wedding and a roadtrip.</p>

<p>Early in June, my older sister married her long-time girlfriend and fiancée. This being the first wedding of my siblings and my first as an adult, it was quite a different experience from those I attended when I was in elementary school. (Read: more fun, and even more intimidating.)</p>

<p>Shortly before moving back to IU, I joined my brother, our best friend Eric, and a bunch of my brother’s climbing buddies on a road trip to go camping and climbing in Kentucky’s beatiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_Gorge">Red River Gorge</a>. Somewhere in the middle of all the sublime hiking and getting my ass kicked by the crags, I fell in love with the sport and promptly signed up for an indoor climbing class at IU as soon as I got back to a computer.</p>
<p>While that climbing class has been awesome so far, I’m even more excited to be back for my computer science classes. On the strong advice of Suzanne Menzel, my <a href="../tags/c211.html">C211: Introduction to Computer Science</a> instructor, I skipped one of the two courses typically taken in the next semester. As a result, I am shoehorning the remaining of the two—foundational computing theory—in with the standard third semster courses—a data structures and algorithms course in Java, and a systems class in which we will program a custom ARM setup in C and assembly.</p>
<p>As if I won’t be doing enough programming with that courseload, I’ve also started two new jobs this fall. The first is a volunteer position as an intern working for the School of Informatics and Computing’s <a href="http://serveit.soic.indiana.edu/">Serve IT</a> clinic, which does IT consulting for local non-profits. I’ll be working on the Special Ops team tackling several projects over the course of the semester<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, beginning with implementing PHP templates for a new Drupal-based website for the Leadership Bloomington - Monroe County Alumni Association. Since I have no prior experience with Drupal or PHP, I’ve hit the ground running.</p>
<p>My second job (which actually pays!<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>) is working as an Undergraduate Instructor for C211. This position consists of teaching labs, grading labs and exams, holding office hours, and whatever else new Suzanne comes up with every week. I’m really looking forward to gaining new perspectives on programming from watching and helping the students in my sections work through their labs and homework.</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying every minute of being back in Bloomington and all the chaos that comes with it this fall. We’ll see what sort of tune I’ll be singing when it all peaks come finals in three months, however.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Most Serve IT teams typically work with a single client agency over the course of a semester or longer on a specific project. The Special Ops team, however, works mostly on finishing previous projects and other projects with similarly accelerated schedules.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Okay, so these kind of positions are usually slave wages, but all it takes to keep me happy is enough for a new pair of Vibrams about once a year, entry fees for a race or two, and enough to buy beer that’s worth drinking.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
