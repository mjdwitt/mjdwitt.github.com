		<p>Fall 2012, Week 11: deadlines, scheduling, interviews, and more deadlines. This semester is nearly two-thirds complete and it couldn’t possibly move any faster.</p>
<p>As the end of the semester quickly approaches, deadlines for both classwork and Serve IT projects seem to arrive with an ever increasing size and pace. In my systems class, we have been learning the protocols and interfaces necessary to make use of various hardware peripherals such as a screen, SD card, Wii Nunchuck, and more. In our most recent labs, we’ve begun to use many of these interfaces in layers and in parallel in order to cause input in one peripheral to affect output in another. While there are a lot of extremely frustrating small details that inexorably double our time spent on each project, the rush of smashing these bugs and finally getting a working hardware system is amazing. While the pace in this class is fairly consistent, homework and lab assignments seem to grow larger every week.</p>
<p>In contrast, my data structures and algorithms class has been seen a dramatic increase in its pace over the semester. Perhaps this is in part to beginning with material with which I was mostly familiar, but we have recently begun completing two parallel assignments every week—the second noticeable increase in assignment tempo in the past two months. The work is very interesting and even more useful as we begin to apply the content from our theory assignments (which have given me a reason to finally learn LaTeX) to practical programming assignments. I look forward to finally finishing my Java-based music player/library project in these remaining weeks with the rest of my team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scheduling for the spring semester has already begun. I’m really excited about CS classes for which I have already enrolled: operating systems, programming languages (with the great Dan Friedman!), and an introduction to the mathematics of information security. In addition, I’m working out some scheduling conflicts with another class which will end up either being an intermediate course in symbolic logic or linear algebra, either of which are very appealing<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I have also continued my work with my two jobs mentioned in my last post working as an undergraduate instructor and with the school’s Serve IT clinic. My work with the clinic has been extremely informative and educational; I’m finally getting around to learning PHP and JavaScript after years of putting that off. After a quick self-taught crash course in both languages and in Drupal, I have spent most of these eleven weeks implementing a templating system for a client’s Drupal website. I look forward to completing the template in the next week or two and moving on to building Drupal modules for this and other websites.</p>
<p>While I have learned a lot from Serve IT, it can hardly hold a candle to my experience as a UI for the intro computer science course this semester. Not only have I finally conquered the last remainders of a once formidable fear of public speaking, but I have done so while learning how to explain quite technical concepts to people with no prior experience. I have also built on my knowledge of scheme while assisting students with labs and homework and while writing auto-grader scripts for said assignments. I definitely plan on working more as a UI in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of work, I am currently in the process of interviewing with several companies about engineering internships for this summer. This is my first experience with any real interviews and as such, I find it quite stressful in spite of my confidence in my skills. All nervousness aside, getting to know these companies has been great and I would love to work with any of them come May.</p>
<p>Wether my summer is spent in Chicago, Indianapolis, or on either coast, I can’t wait to take these next steps in my life. More immediately, I am looking forward to the rapidly-approaching winter holidays and spending time with my family, our dogs, and my old friends.</p>
