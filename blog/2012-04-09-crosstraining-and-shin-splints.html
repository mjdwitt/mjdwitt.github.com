		<p>While training for the <a href="http://www.hawthornhalfdayrelay.com/">Hawthorn Half Day</a> (HHD) last Spring, my brother Andrew and I learned a lot about willpower and ourselves harder mentally than we thought possible. This spring, however, as we train harder in an attempt to run over eighty miles between the two of us at the 2012 HHD, we are also learning about our physical growth limits and the importance of cross-training.</p>
<p>In the past week, I’ve had my first experience with injuries from a lack of cross-training. Seven days ago, I woke up with such a pain in my shins that I was barely able to walk for about an hour. It had happened eight days ago as well, but to a lesser extent that seemed normal for the morning after running over twenty miles. Four days later, I was still experiencing that pain, although it had abated some.</p>
<p>After talking with some other ultra runners, I learned that extreme shin splints like those I was experiencing were a common indicator of insufficient cross-training, especially among those that run in Vibrams as I do. Apparently the calve muscles will recover and grow stronger more easily than the much-smaller smaller muscles on the front of the shins. This leads to stress and swelling in the tendons on the front and, if ignored, can lead to stress fractures.</p>
<p>The same friends recommended that I try a simple routine<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> to bring the front of my shins up to strength as fast as possible. With luck, this should bring me back onto our training schedule in time to still make my goals for the HHD. If not, I’ve still got the eight hour solo ultra at the <a href="http://www.kennekuk.com/events.htm#Howl">Howl at the Moon</a> at the end of the summer.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>With your heels on the ground, lift your toes and the balls of your feet as high off the ground as you can and hold for ten to fifteen seconds, then relax for a few seconds. Repeat until the fronts of your shins are fatigued. Do this many time throughout the day to see faster improvement.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
</ol>
