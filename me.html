		<p>I’m Michael DeWitt. You’re visiting my website. This page is all about me.</p>
<h1 id="i-like-learning-new-things">I like learning new things</h1>
<p>Fittingly, I’m currently in school at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. In a few years time I’ll have taken most of the classes offered here by the <a href="http://www.soic.indiana.edu">School of Informatics and Computing</a> that sound interesting and graduate with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. The most intriguing sounding courses here all lead to either a Programming Languages or a Systems specialization and the school also offers an extremely interesting sounding Security Informatics minor which I certainly plan on pursuing while I am here.</p>
<p>I’m currently learning about Scheme and broad security concepts (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) in my classes while I teach myself about Haskell, linux, and application development in my free time.</p>
<p>I eventually want to earn a Ph.D., but I plan on getting industry experience with building real-world products and protocols first. I’d like to think now that any graduate studies I undertake later would have something to do with security research, but I am constantly finding new and interesting things to learn, so that could quite easily change. Ultimately, however, the Ph.D. is not even a necessity so long as I can find some way to spend the rest of my life constantly learning.</p>
<h1 id="other-things-i-like">Other things I like</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Running:</p>
<p>I’m not really all that great at it, objectively speaking, but I find that I learn a lot about myself and my willpower when I run, especially when training for ultramarathons. My twin brother and I ran our first ultra, the <a href="http://www.hawthornhalfdayrelay.com/">Hawthorn Half Day</a>, after he took a joke of mine seriously and we haven’t looked back since.</p></li>
<li><p>Beer:</p>
<p>Home-brew is a half-hobby of mine; that is, I enjoy reading about it and learning about my brother’s and my cousin’s experiments, but I have yet to find the time to brew a batch of my own. I certainly enjoy discovering new beers and good beer pubs though.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux:</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> on all of my machines after getting sick of the long compile times of Gentoo. I also enjoy playing around different distributions like <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos">NixOS</a> and <a href="http://qubes-os.org">Qubes</a>. Although I am sometimes tempted by the allure of an already-configured unix system like OSX, I wouldn’t trade a good package manager like Arch’s <code>pacman</code> for anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Cooking:</p>
<p>Every time I eat something new and delicious, I try to figure out what it’s made with and how it was put together. Then, I go home and try to recreate it in my own kitchen and see if I can’t improve on it while I’m at it.</p></li>
<li><p>The internet:</p>
<p>After growing up in a household of early-adopters who had last used dial-up internet before I was forming memories, I cannot even begin to imagine what life would be like without this massive wealth of knoweldge at my fingertips all the time. If you spend time on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mjdwitt">Hacker News</a> or the Arch Linux <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=46312">forums</a>, you might find me posting under <code>mjdwitt</code>. Chances are also high that if you see that handle on any other site, that’s me as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading good fiction, when I have time left.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="you-should-talk-to-me">You should talk to me</h1>
<p>If there’s one thing I enjoy more than any of the above, it’s good conversation. If you have questions, comments, or criticisms about anything you find here or you just want to talk about something that you think I may be interested in, don’t hesitate to get a hold of me. For smaller things, tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/mjdwitt">@mjdwitt</a>. If it’s a more complex or sensitive matter, than send me an email at <script type="text/javascript">
